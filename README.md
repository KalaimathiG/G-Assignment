Below are the steps carried out in this notebook.

1) removed columns based on description
2)univariate analysis
3)Missing values Imputation
4)outlier detection(3*std method) and cleansing
5)Multicollinearity Check (removed cols with very high VIF)
6)Heatmap and handled correlated columns
7)Handling imbalanced class(oversmapling of minority class)
8)encoding categorical variables
9)standardizing the columns
10)model creation
